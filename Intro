Classification of Data Structure 
Linear Data 
struc t 
Static Data 
Stru re 
O ata Structure 
Non r Data 
Dynamic Data 
Graph 
Struc re 
Linked list 

Linear data structure – in sequence, one after another  
Non-linear data structure – non sequential 

Static data structure – fixed memory size 
Dynamic data structure – memory size is not fix 

Array – in continuous memory location 
Queue – follows FIFO 
Stack – follows LIFO 
Linked list – non continuous memory location, linked by pointers 
Tree – herarchical, linked by nodes 
Graph – linked by nodes and edges
